2.      Check in: Require NAME and ID and book a room(single room, double room or family size)

Hongxiang Zheng and Yingbin Zheng will be in charge of  use Swing to design the system interface(5 parts:"booking" window, "check in" window, "order serve" window, "check out" window and "show table" window, in order to  landscaping interface, we will add a “current time” window and a “Logo” window)
2.     Xiang cao and Hongxiang Zheng will be responsible for  use JDBC to connect MySQL database(complete the operations like generate, delete, modify,save). We also need create some tables like service table, customers’ info table and so on.
3.     Yingbin Zheng will create a interface for customers, which can realize the booking part in another computer through database sharing function.
