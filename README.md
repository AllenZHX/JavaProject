Project Description: We develop a Hotel Management System used JAVA combine with MySQL. We focus on check in, service and check out.
Swing:  mainly including the knowledge of JLabel, JTextField, JButton, JTabel, JPanel, FlowLayout, GridLayout, JScrollPane, JFrame, ActionListener.

2.      Service: drink, food, dry cleaning, massage
3.      Check out: Settle account.

The responsibility distribution:
1.    Hongxiang Zheng and Yingbin Zheng will be in charge of  use Swing to design the system interface(4 parts: “check in” window,“order serve” window, “check out” window and “show table” window, in order to  landscaping interface, we will add a “current time” window and a “Logo” window)
2.     Xiang cao will be responsible for  use JDBC to connect MySQL database(complete the operations like generate, delete, modify,save). We also need create some tables like service table, customers’ info table and so on.
